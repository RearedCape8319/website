#### A website that houses some of my little random coding projects

This is where I will store the code files for my website. On my website will be a bunch of random stuff I fancied making, from games to illustrations.

The following is a list of things I have added or want to add:
- [ ] _Wobbly circle with noise_
- [ ] _A snake using inverse kinematics_
- [ ] _Marchnig squares algorithm_
- [ ] _Tic Tac Toe with minimax and alpha-beta pruning_
- [ ] _Circle packing_
- [ ] _Frogger_

The project was created using the following:
- **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org)
- **Express** (https://expressjs.com/)
- **P5.js** (https://p5js.org/)
