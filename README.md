#### A website that houses some of my little random coding projects

This is where I will store the code files for my website. On my website will be a bunch of random stuff I fancied making, from games to illustrations.

Site is hosted at (https://rearedcape.herokuapp.com/).

### The following is a list of things I have added or want to add:
- [x] _Wobbly circle with noise_
- [x] _Sierpinski Triangle_
- [ ] _Circle packing_
- [ ] _Marchnig squares algorithm_
- [ ] _Tic Tac Toe with minimax and alpha-beta pruning_
- [ ] _A snake using inverse kinematics_
- [ ] _Frogger_
- [ ] _Hitomezashi Stitch Patterns_

### The project was created using the following:
- **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org)
- **Nodemon** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
- **Express** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- **P5.js** (https://p5js.org/)
